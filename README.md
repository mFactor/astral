# Astral
## An isomorphic web application framework focused on minimalism and performance.
## Built on Node, React, Redux, and LESS.

* Scalable - From single-page dashboards to enterprise apps, Astral allows for a
flexible application structure to fit any need.

* Minimal - While some critical development details have been enforced, the
majority of backend tools and architecture choices have been intentionally
omitted. This allows for any database, middleware, and other logic
to be set in as seen fit by the developer.

* Fast - The fully isomorphic stack with server-side rendering for all front-end
components helps makes applications blazing fast. A simple, yet powerful,
approach to development and production keeps the focus on application logic
instead of infrastructure administration.
